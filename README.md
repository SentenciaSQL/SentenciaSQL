Hi, I'm AndrÃ©s FrÃ­as, full stack developer involved in the entire software development life cycle. I am passionate about technology and a self-taught student. I love trying new technologies and I am in search of constant learning. My goal is to work with projects that challenges me as a full stack developer that allows me to apply the knowledge acquired in years of study and work.
